K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explains and demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is one of the simplest and most effective algorithms for solving classification and regression problems in machine learning.


Overview

KNN works by finding the closest data points (neighbors) to a target point and making predictions based on those neighbors.

For classification, it assigns the most common label among the neighbors.

For regression, it averages the values of the neighbors.

The algorithm can also weight neighbors by distance, giving closer points more influence.
